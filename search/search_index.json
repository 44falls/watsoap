This tool purpose is to automatically monitor the health of APIs. Features \u00b6 Collects the current health status of configured APIs. Generates the health status reports in a variety of file formats. Prerequisite \u00b6 Install git , If it is already installed, ignore it. Install Python , If it is already installed, ignore it. If Poetry is not already installed on your local machine, proceed as follows. $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip $ pip install poetry Setup \u00b6 With GIT \u00b6 Clone this repository to your local machine. $ git https://github.com/nawinto99/watsoap.git Change the working directory as follows. $ cd watsoap Run following command which will install the necessary dependencies. $ poetry install Rename the .env.dummy file in the config folder to .env. Usage \u00b6 requests.yml : This file contains a list of requests, request's name should be unique in the list. requests_data.yml : This file contains the data required to initiate each request. Create one dictionary object for each request, and the name should exactly match the map key name mentioned in step one. .env : This file contains the Tokens, API keys, usernames and passwords, and other sensitive information. Update requests.yml \u00b6 Create endpoints the list's map key name. The name of the request should be unique in the list. It is recommended that capital letters and underscores be used for separate letters. Sample: \u00b6 endpoints: - MOCKBIN - JSON_PLACE_HOLDER Modify the requests data configuration file. Make sure to match the endpoint names as mentioned in step #1 . For each endpoint, create following list of keys. If you have common data for multiple endpoints, declare the GENERIC path and mention value as GENERIC to refer the value from GENERIC for each endpoint. /config/requests_data.yml base_url: Endpoint URL. method: Request method type. payload: Request Payload. params: Request Query Strings. auth_type: Authentication types, select one from following list ['NO-AUTH','BASIC', 'API-KEY']. auth_env_name: Authentication Environment Variable name, refer step #3 for more details.
